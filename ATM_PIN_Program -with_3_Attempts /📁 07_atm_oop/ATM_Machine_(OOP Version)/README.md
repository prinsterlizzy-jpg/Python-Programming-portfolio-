# 🏦 ATM Machine (OOP Version)

This project is a clean and well-structured **Object-Oriented Python ATM system**.  
It demonstrates the use of **classes, methods, attributes, error handling, loops, and user interaction**.

The program simulates basic ATM operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds — all handled using an `ATM` class.

## 🎯 Features

### ✔ Object-Oriented Design  
- `ATM` class with attributes and methods  
- Encapsulated balance and PIN logic  

### ✔ PIN Authentication  
- Hardcoded PIN (`1234`) for demo  
- User gets *3 attempts*  
- Blocks access after failed attempts  

### ✔ ATM Operations
