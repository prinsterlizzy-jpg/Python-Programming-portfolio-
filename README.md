# Python Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Programming Portfolio — a collection of practical, beginner-friendly to intermediate Python projects.  
This portfolio showcases my understanding of core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, user input handling, simple data structures, and real-world logical problem-solving.

The projects are organized clearly, each with source code, screenshots, and individual documentation.
